# Knights Travails
🛠️ Under Construction: This project explores graph traversal using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path a knight can take on a standard 8×8 chessboard. Each square is treated as a node in an implicit graph, and knight moves represent edges. The goal is to compute the minimum-move path from a starting position to a target square.
