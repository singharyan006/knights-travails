## 📖 Overview

**Knight’s Travails** is a pathfinding challenge that simulates a knight's movements on a standard 8×8 chessboard. The knight can move in “L” shapes, and this project calculates the **shortest path** it can take from a starting square to a target square using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

This project demonstrates how **graph traversal algorithms** and **core data structures** like arrays and objects can be applied to real-world problems.

## 🧠 What This Project Teaches

- Thinking of a chessboard as an implicit **graph**
- Applying **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find shortest paths
- Using **queues**, **visited tracking**, and **path reconstruction**
- Embracing problem-solving with only **core JavaScript constructs** — arrays, objects, factory functions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/singharyan006/knights-travails.git
cd knights-travails
```
### 2. Run the test script
```bash
node test.js
```
---

## 3.💡Sample Output
```bash
You made it in 2 moves! Here's your path:
[0,0]
[1,2]
[3,3]
```

```bash
You made it in 6 moves! Here's your path:
[0,0]
[2,1]
[4,2]
[6,3]
[7,5]
[5,6]
[7,7]
```

## ⚙️ Tech Used

- JavaScript (ES5+)
- Node.js (runtime to test the script)
- No external libraries — only core JS features

## 🧩 Real-World Relevance: DSA in Action

This project shows how **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** solve real-world problems:

- 🧠 **Graphs** model relationships between locations (like maps, boards, networks).
- 🚀 **BFS** finds optimal routes — just like in GPS apps, logistics systems, or multiplayer game AIs.
- 📥 **Queues** simulate step-by-step exploration — useful in simulations, scheduling, and job processing.
- 🔄 **Visited tracking** prevents loops — crucial for memory optimization and performance.

By solving the knight’s traversal problem, we simulate the kind of logical reasoning used in:

- 🗺️ Route optimization
- 🧠 AI decision-making
- 🎮 Game development
- 🌐 Networking and pathfinding systems

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- ✅ Add CLI input using `readline-sync` to allow custom user input
- 🔄 Add a visual board representation (text-based)
- 🧪 Write unit tests for core logic using Jest
- ♻️ Animate paths step-by-step in the console
- 🌐 Build a web-based UI version using React or Canvas
- 📦 Refactor into modules with a more scalable architecture
